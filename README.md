# BludBourne
A libGDX RPG game using artemis-odb and JaCoCo test code coverage

**Status**: Still in development!!!

This pet project is my attempt to learn to use libGDX on a larger scale.
I'm implemented artemis-odb to avoid code clutter and developing via TDD methodology.
Hopefully it all works out :).

BludBourne was built thanks to the work of...

1. Patrick Hoey's [Mastering LibGDX Game Development](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-LibGDX-Game-Development-Patrick/dp/1785289365) for providing tutorials and assets
2. [junkdog](https://github.com/junkdog) for the development of [artemis-odb](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb)
3. James Cook's [LibGDX Game Development By Example](https://www.amazon.com/LibGDX-Game-Development-Example-James/dp/1785281445) for a solid introduction to libGDX.
4. And of course the [libGDX framework](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and its' awesome community!
