# BludBourne
A libGDX RPG game using ~~artemis-odb~~ Ashley ECS, Overlap2D and JaCoCo test code coverage.

**Status**: Still in development!!!

UPDATE: 7/28/16
Dropped support for HTML since there is no HTML Overlap2D runtime at this moment.
Dropped support for Android to avoid complexities involving viewports and controls. 

This pet project is my attempt to learn to use libGDX on a larger scale.
I've implemented artemis-odb to avoid code clutter and developing via TDD methodology.
Hopefully it all works out :).
